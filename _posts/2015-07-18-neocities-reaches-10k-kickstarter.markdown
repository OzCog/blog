[We made it to $10,000 on Kickstarter!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1262953102/neocities-30-an-interactive-html-css-course-for-ev/)

A huge thank you to all of you for getting us to our first stretch goal. With this funding we'll be able to add a lot more content to the course, delving deep into CSS and sharing fun web design ideas and tips. There's a little over a week left to our campaign, leaving us some more time to reach for other goals like adding JavaScript chapters and improving Neocities' infrastructure. Meanwhile, we're researching and brainstorming for the course and finishing up miscellaneous fixes on the Neocities site.

Want to help out? [Check out the Neocities Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1262953102/neocities-30-an-interactive-html-css-course-for-ev/) and help us get to our next stretch goal. With $20,000 we'll be able to provide a beginner JavaScript course for Neocities sites!

Cheers,

-- Victoria & Kyle

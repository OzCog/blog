[People create amazing sites on Neocities](https://neocities.org/browse), and we've wanted to provide a way for people to give back to the awesome people working on them. So we did!

Introducing **Neocities Site Tipping**. Now any site on Neocities can enable and start receiving site donations!

If you have a Neocities site and want to get started, Visit your **Settings** page, click **Manage Site Settings** and click the **Tipping** tab. You will need to provide the email address for your [PayPal](https://paypal.com) account, which will enable both PayPal and Credit Card donations to be sent.

If you'd like to use a Bitcoin address instead, no problem! Just enter your Bitcoin address, and it will be integrated in your site profile. Bitcoin donations won't show up on news feeds yet, but we'll look for ways to improve this in the future.

I'm calling site tipping a beta for now, just in case something goes horribly wrong (abuse issues, etc), but I don't expect any problems we can't solve.

It's important to note that **Neocities will not deduct any fees for donations**. PayPal will charge a small fee (which is comparable to the rate for Credit Card transactions), but we won't receive any of it. If you'd like to support Neocities as well, we have a separate [donations](https://neocities.org/donate) page, or you can help sustain Neocities by becoming a [supporter](https://neocities.org/supporter).

Finally, if you're feeling tipsy, [here's a list of some of the many sites on Neocities now accepting tips](https://neocities.org/browse?sort_by=tipping_enabled).

Enjoy!
